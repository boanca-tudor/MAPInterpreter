# MAPInterpreter

Toy Language Interpreter done using Java.

The toy language supports multiple Java features such as:

1. General variable declaration, relational, boolean and arithmetic operations
2. Conditionals, Loops
3. File I/O
4. References (Heap Allocated Variables)
5. Parallel execution (simillar to the Linux fork)

The project also has a working GUI, which allows step by step execution of each
available program.
The GUI was created using the JavaFX library.
